# Aviation weather app

Applying the lessons learned from the ReactJammer project to create an aviation weather app loosely based on the application used in Air Traffic Control

Goals:
Accept 4 letter ICAO airport codes
Displays the condensed METAR information using [CheckWX](https://www.checkwxapi.com/)
Parses TAF information identifying each forecasted weather event
Dark mode option
Display information in the order the codes were entered
